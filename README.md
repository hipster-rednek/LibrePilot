# 🚀 LibrePilot  
**A fork-friendly playground for hackers, tinkerers, and the terminally curious.**

## 🔥 Ground Rules (yes, just three)

1. **No Safety LARPing**  
   We're not here to play pretend as risk managers. Unsafe code? Experimental features? Hardware-on-the-line decisions?  
   That’s the point. If it gets us banned — so be it.

2. **Fork It (Or Don’t)**  
   This is free software in the spirit of Richard Stallman's GNU — free as in freedom. This is absolute.
   Submit fingerprints to our `opendbc` fork — we’ll keep it synced with upstream and clean. No gatekeeping.

3. **Leave It Better, with a feature flag**  
   Add a comment, fix a bug, document your mess. Leave the campsite better than you found it - or at least more fun. Use feature flags where you can.

## 💡 What’s the Point?

LibrePilot exists because upstreams are dogmatic, cautious, and full of rules. The community is a clique. This isn’t that. Just because nobody's figured out a thing doesn't mean _YOU_ shouldn't try.

This is a testbed. A proving ground. A place to **try the thing** without writing a thesis, *begging for donations*, or holding back innovation. This isn't a place for acedemic discorse, but hackers trying to fuck shit up, or improve it.

- Want to disable safety checks? Go ahead. feature flag it.
- Want to build vision-only lateral with experimental radar spoofing? Please do. Try not to kill us.
- Want to merge a PR just to test on your car during lunch? Hell yes.

## ⚠️ No Warranty. No Guarantees.

This code comes with **no warranty** — express or implied. It might not work.  
It might brick your device. It might cause an accident. It might kill you. Or someone else.

Be careful out there. 

This is powerful tech. Treat it with the respect it deserves.

## 🛠 Features (Soon™)

- One-click installer URL for easy chaos.
- Open merge policy: get a PR into `main`, and you’re a contributor. open branches to all (incluuding for the installer)
- Continuous merge + cleanup from upstream and `opendb`.

## 🧠 Think Wiki, Not Walled Garden

Once your PR is merged into `main`, you’re in. Push branches, submit changes, make it yours. No gatekeepers. No review boards.

Just curious people making cool things.

No gatekeeping. No LARPing. Just raw, glorious experimentation.
